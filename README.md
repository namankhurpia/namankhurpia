## About Me

Hello, I’m a Data Scientist focused on building systems that solve real, human-centered problems. I enjoy turning ideas into working products, and most of my projects are open-source and available below.

🔭 I’m currently working with PyTorch and TensorFlow, with a strong focus on fine-tuning large language models locally. I’ve also built end-to-end implementations of transformer-based models, including GPT-style architectures, to better understand model internals rather than treating them as black boxes.

I try not to limit myself with stack rather I have developed myself to code in any language be it one you created.
